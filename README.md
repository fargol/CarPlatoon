# CarPlatoon
 This Project illustrates a dynamic simulation of a car-following system, which contains three cars in one single line. This simulation is implemented by the multilayer perceptron (MLP) based on the fuzzy logic. This simulation is designed to prevent a car following collision system by adjusting the velocity and distance among the three cars. The input and the target value in the MLP are generated by 25 fuzzy rules in the fuzzy inference system (FIS). In order to represent a perfect generalization of the FIS system, the number of hidden nodes in the MLP networks should be set precisely. Setting the unappropriated number of hidden nodes in the MLP networks causes an overfitting of trained data, and creates noise in the regression model.  The data in the MLP networks are trained by the Levenberg-Marquart backpropagation algorithm. If I reduce the velocity and distance among the cars, it causes an accident. So, the problem is tackled with changing the type of my membership function, the geometric type of membership function, and the defuzzification method. Also, the implantation of the car-following in the Simulink in the MATLAB software is not convenient for the user to put the initial values or the desired values in. In order to overcome this limitation, I design the carplatoon system in GUIDE in the MATLAB software as well. I then develop the simulation of the car-platoon, which contains four cars.
